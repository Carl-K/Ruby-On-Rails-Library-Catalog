# README

This Ruby On Rails project is from a tutorial found at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/index.htm.  I have learned about Ruby on Rails' MVC design pattern, Active Record, migrations, model, controller, and view files, and scaffolding.  I had to alter the code to compile as I was using a newer verion of Ruby and Rails than the tutorial was using.  I used MySQL and SQLite3 to setup and inspect databases.
